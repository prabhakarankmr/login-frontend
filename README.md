-   **Improved UI/UX**: Further refine the user interface and experience with more animations, transitions, and accessibility features.
-   **Unit and Integration Tests**: Expand test coverage for both frontend components and API integrations.
-   **Containerization**: Dockerize the application for easier deployment and scalability.
-   **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements**: Automate deployment to various environments (staging, production).
